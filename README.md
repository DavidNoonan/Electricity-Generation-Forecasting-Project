# Electricity-Generation-Forecasting-Project
SARIMA model forecasting total U.S. Electricity generation.

This is a project I did using RNotebooks. It's about forecasting total U.S. electricity generation using data from 1985-1996, with a forecast for the year 1997.
Since 1997 already happened, I intend to add a comparison of the forecast with the actual values.

The format is for pdf output. HTML version is in the works.
